This is the story about the color monster. Today he woke up feeling confused, and he does not know why. Are you all mixed up again, Color Monster? Your emotions do not work well when they are all jumbled up. You should try to separate them, and put each one in its own jar. If you like, I can help you with that. Lets try to make sense of how you feel. I am going to start describing the happiness. It shines yellow like the Sun and twinkles like the Stars. When you are happy, you jump and dance and play and laugh: ahh ha ha ha!. You want to share your happiness with everyone!. Ok, I you have it clear, we will continue exploring another one, the sadness. It is lonely and blue like a rainy day it washes over you like the sea. When you are sad you hide and want to be alone. You do not want to do anything except maybe cry: snif snif. Finally, and this is the last one, the calm. It is quiet like the trees and as light as the green leaves swaying in the wind. When you are calm, you breathe slowly and deeply. You feel at peace. Now you can rest, Color Monster! All your feelings are in the right place. I hope you have learned to differentiate between the diferent emotions! Do not you feel much better?
