I rejected the idea of living separate lifes. Sincerely, I could not stand it anymore, I felt tired of crying all the time, I could not remain hidden. Thus, I took courage to go to his home and, sweating intensely I ringed the doorbell ding-dong. Nothing! I heavily insisted but it did not make any noise. Obviously, it was broken. I had no choice but to harm my knuckles knocking the door knock knock and suddenly, the door blade opened. I closed my eyes before saying hello with a scared and trembling voice. And I felt a kiss in my red, soft and full lips. Oh Lord, what a disappointment, what a strong deception! I was gifted with a boring, dull and tasteless kiss! where were the butterflies in the stomach? where the timeless sensation? the thirst for more? No words were needed. It was time to open my eyes and realize that I was free finally. I barely looked to his head, made half turn and walked towards the exit. For the first time I was able to breath deeply, to forget the emotional burden with which I had carried out on my shoulders and, shit, to be able to be happy again. I celebrated it with a cold, big and tasty beer in the first pub I found on my way home.
